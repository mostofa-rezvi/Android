## ➡️Overview

This is a native Android application for a food delivery and ordering system. The project is built using Java and Firebase, leveraging Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Cloud Storage, and Firebase Authentication. The project incorporates modern software design patterns such as Adapter, Singleton, and MVC. It also includes comprehensive testing with unit tests, UI tests, and continuous integration (CI) testing.

## ➡️Features

- **User Authentication:** Sign up, login, and logout functionality using Firebase Authentication.

- **Real-time Updates:** Receive real-time updates on order status via Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Image Uploads:** Upload and view images for menu items and restaurant profiles using Firebase Cloud Storage.

## ➡️Design Patterns

### 1. Adapter Design Pattern
Used to manage the communication between different parts of the application, such as converting data from Firebase into a format that can be displayed in the UI.

### 2. Singleton Design Pattern
Ensures that certain classes, like the Firebase database instance, are created only once throughout the application lifecycle.

### 3. MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller)
Separates the application into three interconnected components:
- **Model:** Manages the data and business logic.
- **View:** Handles the UI and displays data to the user.
- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between Model and View, processing user input and updating the Model.

## ➡️Testing

### Unit Testing
Unit tests are written to verify the functionality of individual components and methods within the application.

### UI Testing
UI tests ensure that the user interface operates correctly and provides a smooth user experience.

### CI Testing
Continuous Integration (CI) testing is set up to automatically run tests on new commits to ensure code quality and functionality.
